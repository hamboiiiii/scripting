	<p>Coaldale is a small town located in rural Alberta, Canada. Coaldale is honestly one of the best examples of a rural small town most could think of. It is surrounded by farmland on all sides, with a couple of highways going into Lethbridge. People seldom go to Coaldale for activities or entertainment unless it is during an event.  They do have some hometown restaurants that are a must-try like Wallyâ€™s Pizza and K.C.'s Pub and Grill, alongside a few recreation centers and parks for playing sports.</p><img src="images/old_mclennans.jpg" alt="Old McLennan's"><img src="images/new_mclennans.jpg" alt="New Mclennan's">
	<p class="bottom-text"> As mentioned before, they also hold some annual events such as a demolition derby, a candy parade, as well as Canada Day festivities. Being in Coaldale is a very homey experience for those from the big city looking for a secluded place to have some peace from the much worse hustle and bustle. The one downside is the geography of the town, as wind is a very well-known issue here year-round.</p>
