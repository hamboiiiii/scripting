It was quite "+adj2+" out, so we really needed to "+verb2+". We started down "+noun1+" Street and realized this might be more of a "+adj3+" trip than we anticipated, as a cluster of "+nouns2+" was blocking the entire intersection and sidewalk. We had no clue why the herd of "+nouns2+" was there, but it was. We decided to detour down "+noun1+" Avenue and make a right down "+noun3+" Street. This road had no "+nouns2+" in the way to the "+noun2+", so we ran as "+adj1+" as we could down the sidewalk. The "+noun1+" outside was causing us to sweat profusely as the need for "+noun2+" grew in our minds. As the urgency of the "+noun2+" grew, so did our speed. Our feet "+verb1+" against the ground as the "+noun1+" grew closer, and we knew we had "+verb2+" in our task. As soon as we stepped onto the property, our eyes grew "+adj2+" as we saw the most "+adj1+" thing we had ever seen. A sign that read three words: FREE "+nouns1+" INSIDE. We almost "+verb2+" the door as we rush inside. The "+noun3+" behind the counter "+verbs1+" us at the door. We don’t even "+verb1+" at him as we "+verb1+" toward the "+noun1+" machine. We both grab our cups and fill them with "+noun1+", and we take the cups to the counter. The "+noun3+" rings up our order, and charges "+numb1+" dollars for them. We collectively lose our "+nouns1+" as we explain the sign out front that says “FREE "+nouns1+" INSIDE,” and they immediately turn "+adj2+" as the "+noun3+" corrects their mistake and rings us up. We take our free "+nouns1+" outside, and walk down the street, and make our way down to the bench in "+noun1+" park. We sit down and start drinking our "+nouns1+" and start "+verb1+". We then were approached by a group of "+nouns2+", who started to "+verb2+" us so we would give up our "+nouns1+". My "+noun1+" and I proceeded to "+adj1+" so hard that literally every "+noun1+" in their group simply started "+verb1+". They apologize, and "+verb1+" as fast away from us as I have ever seen someone go. I remember this day every time there is a "+adj2+" "+noun1+" day out, I look outside and "+verb2+" to myself.<p2><br><img src='happy.jpeg' alt='Happy Face'>";
